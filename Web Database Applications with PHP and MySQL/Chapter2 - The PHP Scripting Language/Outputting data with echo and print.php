<?php

print "Hello, world" . "<br>";

// echo works just the same
echo "Hello, world" . "<br>";

// numbers can be printed with echo too
echo 123, "<br>";

print 456;

// So can the contents of variables
$outputString = "Hi!";

echo $outputString;

print $outputString;

// The difference between print and echo is that echo can output more than one parameter,
// each separated by a comma.
echo "The answer is ", 43;
